| **Granularity**                      | 9 short, single-purpose methods—each targets one public API path (startGame, tilePressed, etc.).                                 | 11 focused methods—each validates one configuration rule or statistic.                                                                                                                              | 15 scenario-driven methods that exercise small “stories” . | \~30 bite-sized methods, each tied to one listener branch or GUI delegation.                                                                          | Tests are deliberately **small & specific**; no monolithic “kitchen-sink” test.          |
| **Meaningfulness vs. coverage-only** | Asserts both the **return value** *and* that the correct collaborator (mocked Model & View) is called.                           | Confirms that difficulty strings map to the expected mine counts, custom validation throws when inappropriate, stats counters increment correctly, etc. | Verifies *actual game outcomes*: mine counts, win detection, hint logic. | Uses spies/mocks to check that the right view behaviour fires (playGame vs. playAgain vs. exit), and stubs GUI methods so head-less runs don’t crash. | Emphasis is on **behavioural assertions**.                                               |
| **Edge-case handling**               | Invalid difficulty, null callbacks skipped via `Assume` in head-less mode.                                                       | Invalid difficulty string throws; custom rows/cols/mines mismatch; zero extra-lives; best-time when no games played.                                                                                | 1-mine 2×2 board, recursive clears on corner tiles, hint with no safe moves.                            | GUI events in head-less VM, right-click vs. left-click, menu actions with stubs to avoid JFrames.                                                     | Edge and corner-cases are explicitly covered in each layer.                              |
| **Inputs, Outputs & State**          | Checks **inputs→delegation** (method args) *and* persistent state (controller’s model/view references via reflection injection). | Asserts getters after setters and after `resetGame()`.                                                                                                                                              | Validates grid/exposed arrays, `playerWon()` flags, last-pressed tile state.                            | Tests that view updates internal fields (`gameframe.pressed()`), not just that methods return.                                                        | Both **observable outputs and internal state mutations** are exercised where meaningful. |
